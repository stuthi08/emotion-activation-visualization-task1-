# Task 1: Visualizing CNN Activation Maps for Emotion Detection

## Overview

This project is part of the internship assignment under the course curriculum, specifically linked to the facial emotion detection application developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of this task is to visualize internal activation maps of the trained model to better understand how different filters react to various facial regions, thus bringing interpretability to the model's decision-making process.

---

## Objective

To extract and visualize activation maps from selected convolutional layers of the emotion detection CNN model developed during the core internship project. This task directly extends the core application and is not treated as a separate or standalone assignment.

---

## Integrated Application

The activation visualization task is tightly integrated with the emotion detection system built as part of the main internship project. The exact same trained CNN model (`emotion_detector_model.h5`) used for prediction was reused here for interpretability and internal analysis.
